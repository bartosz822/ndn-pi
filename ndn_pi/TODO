Enforce localhost security with some default key '/localhost/operator' created in ndn-config

Expose insertIntoCapabilities, expand to include a function to call

Update ndn-config; need separate utility for configuring controller and
general nodes

Add a hook for the controller to add devices (maybe a console-like interface?)

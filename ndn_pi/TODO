Add a hook for the controller to add devices (probably a console-like interface?)

Update ndn-config; need separate utility for configuring controller and
general nodes 
    -OR- 
Use insertIntoCapabilities and put the convention in the README

Extend the private key storage so we can  generate keys (no more ndnsec calls!)

Put localhop configuration in environment variable/config file
